[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:27 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findoctomap_server.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "octomap_server", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "octomap_server"
  with any of the following names:

    octomap_serverConfig.cmake
    octomap_server-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "octomap_server" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "octomap_server_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "octomap_server" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
